# KNN metric influence comparative study
For my statistics course R project I decided to study how metrics influence KNN classifier performance. 
I've also researched tuning hyperparameter K. The project was inspired by similar study conveyed by Hassanat. 
Complete results can be found in article-style report (in Polish).  
DISCLAIMER: report contains some inaccuracies and errors that I haven't known at the time of writing (it was my first ML algorithm ever implemented). It will be corrected at a later date.
